  What you are about to see is the <em>first lesson</em> of the <em>first course</em>
  of this Nanodegree.
</p>
<p>
  You should complete this lesson in a few days if you can. Throughout this lesson you
  will be taking notes on what you're learning. Afterwards, you will convert your notes 
  to simple <b>HTML</b> (like what you're reading now) and then submit them for personalized feedback
  from a Udacity reviewer.
</p>
<p>
  Personal feedback is one of the best parts about taking a Nanodegree, and we want
  you to experience it as early in the program as possible.   
</p>
<p>
  Try your best to complete this lesson (and <b>Stage 0</b> which comes after), within a week of signing up!
